# MontyHallProblem
A simple implementation that demonstrates the solution to the Monty Hall Problem


From the June 2015 Philly Java Users Group Meeting.

We had a side discussion on code commenting a few people wanted the discussion documented for future reference.

I added the slide deck and the example I used to this repo
